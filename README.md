### Motivations
  * Get familiar the MEAN stack and how the components work together

  * Observe how data is passed from server side to the front end
  * Challenge myself
  
### Design
  ![screenshot](./customerapp-shot.jpg)
  The tutorial was mainly focused on the backend, so I added some styling to the buttons and background.  

## Learning Lessons
   
 The first step was trying to understand what each part:
  * Node.js as a runtime
  * ExpressJS as server framework
  * MongoDB as a database - what is a database?
  * EJS as a templating language
